**Research Report -- Social Engineering Attacks**

Social Engineering attacks exploit human trust, curiosity, and procedural weaknesses rather thatn technical flaws.\
Common forms include phishing (email-based), spear-phishing (targeted phishing), pretexting (inventing scenarios to\
solicit information), vishing (voice-based), and quid pro quo (offering services for access). Real incidents-from\
large-scale phishing compromises to employee-targeted social-engineering of platform operators-show that attackers\
can achieve high impact with relatively low technical investment. Effective defense requires a layered approach\
combining people (training, simulated phishing), processes (policy, incident response), and technology (email\
security, MFA, DMARC/SPF/DKIM, endpoint controls).

**What is social engineering?**\
Social engineering is the practice of manipulating people into performing actions or divulging confidential\
information. Rather than exploiting software vulnerabilities, attackers exploit human behavior: trust, authority\
bias, urgency, curiosity, helpfulness, or fear. The attacker's goal may be credential theft, initial access for\
malware, fraud, data exfiltration, or gaining persistent footholds.

**Common types of social engineering attacks**
**Phishing**
Definition: Mass email messages designed to trick rercipients into clicking links, opening attachments, or\
disclosing credentials.\
**Variants**: Credential-phishing (fake login pages), malicious attachments (malware), and generic scams (prize/voucher).\
**Characteristics**: Spoofed sender/display name, urgent language, links to lookalike domains, malicious attachmehts\
(Office macros, executables).

**Spear-Phishing**\
**Definition**: Targeted phishing tailored to an individual or small group using personal or organization-specific details.\
**Characteristics**: Personalized salutations, references to coworkers/projects, timing aligned with events (payroll\
runs, mergers).\
**Pretexting Definition**: Attackers invent a believable pretext (role or scenario) to persuade a target to divulge information\
or perform actions.\
**Examples**: Impersonating IT support to request a password reset, or an auditor requesting sensitive information.\
