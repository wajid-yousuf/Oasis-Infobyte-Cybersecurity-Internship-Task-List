**Vulnerability Scanning with Nikto.**\
Objective: Use Nikto to perform a vulnerability scan on a web server.\
We will use nikto to discover vulnerabilities and misconfigurations., etc. We have two machines, Victim side: Metasploitable, Attacker side: Kali.\
**What is Metasploitable?**\
Metasploitable is an intentionally vulnerable web server used for testing and learning purposes.\
It can be downloaded from the following url: https://sourceforge.net/projects/metasploitable/files/Metasploitable2/metasploitable-linux-2.0.0.zip/download.

Then click on Download Now. Extract the zipped folder.\
In VirtualBox set both VMs on same internal network:\
-> Metasploitable VM -> Settings -> Network -> Adapte 1 -> Host-only Adapter (or Internal Network)\
-> Kali VM -> Settings -> Network -> Adapte 1 -> Host-only Adapter (or Internal Network)\
Logging in to Metasploitable:\
The login for Metasploitable is msfadmin:msfadmin.\

After you log in to Metasploitable, you can identify the IP address that has been assigned to the virtual machine. Just enter ifconfig at the prompt to see the details for the virtual machine.\

And from our Kali VM we will try to ping Metasploitable VM: 'ping -c 3 VM_IP'\
<img width="521" height="174" alt="four" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6b33717-de88-41df-8f27-8841e0348660" />\
We can also run some nmap scans to find web services/versions:\
`sudo nmap -sS -sV -p 1-65535 -T4 VM_IP -oN nmap_full_scan.txt`
With Nmap scan we get the list of all services running on the VM.\
Add nmap_scan.txt\
We can now properly scan it with Nikto, use: 'nikto -host http://VM_IP'\
To save output to a text file use: 'nikto -host http://VM_IP -Format txt -output /folder/nikto_scan_results.txt'

We can demonstrate some backdoors & misconfigurations on Metasploit:\
On port 21, Metasploitable runs vsftpd, an FTP server. This particular one contains a backdoor.\
How the backdoor works:\
If a username is sent that ends in the sequence :), the backdoored version will open a listening port 6200. \
We can demonstrate it with telnet:\

Samba, when configured with a writeable files share and wide links enabled can also be used as a backdoor, to access files that were not meant to be shared.
We will use metasploit and use a pre-made exploit:\

Now we will once again try to login to smbclient:\

We can navigate to 'cd rootfs', 'cd etc', 'more passwd'\
In addition to backdoors & misconfigurations. It has terrible password security for both system and database server accounts.\
We can also access Vulnerable Web Services. To access web applications, type http://VM_IP in the browser.\
<img width="655" height="522" alt="nine" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6b76db6-12dd-4b60-8bcb-b4abb2c788ac" />\
**Information Disclosure:**\
If we navigate to 'http://VM_IP/phpinfo.php', Php information disclosure page can be found.\

The 5.2.4 version may be vulnerable to CVE-2012-1823 and CVE-2012-2311.
